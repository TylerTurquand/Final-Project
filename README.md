## Overview

For this project, the task was to analyze test datasets provided by the BI-Analytics Team to understand the popularity of restaurants and gain insights into factors driving their success. The datasets include information on food, menus, orders, restaurants, and users. The objective was to present a dashboard and analysis report outlining key findings related to restaurant popularity and sales dynamics.

### The Process:

The analysis focused on determining restaurant popularity based on sales amounts and exploring factors influencing sales performance. The popularity of a restaurant was decided based on its sales amounts or revenue generated. Initial findings revealed that a restaurant's average rating showed weak correlation with its sales amounts, with exceptions noted. Filtering for restaurants with higher sales amounts demonstrated a clearer correlation between sales and average ratings. The dashboard showcases sales amounts by cities and cuisines, highlighting top-performers. The top five cities with the highest sales and the top five cuisines recommended for new restaurants were identified, providing actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

### Results

These are the top five cities with the highest sales to consider for new restaurant locations:

1. Tirupati
2. Electronic City, Bangalore
3. Baner, Pune
4. Raipur
5. Malviya Nagar, Delhi
