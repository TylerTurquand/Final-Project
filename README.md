## Overview

For this project, the task was to analyze test datasets provided by the BI-Analytics Team to understand the popularity of restaurants and gain insights into factors driving their success. The datasets include information on food, menus, orders, restaurants, and users. The objective was to present a dashboard and analysis report outlining key findings related to restaurant popularity and sales dynamics.

### Results:

The analysis focused on determining restaurant popularity based on sales amounts and exploring factors influencing sales performance. Initial findings revealed that a restaurant's average rating showed weak correlation with its sales amounts, with exceptions noted. However, filtering for restaurants with higher sales amounts demonstrated a clearer correlation between sales and average ratings. The dashboard created showcased sales amounts by cities and cuisines, highlighting top-performing locations and cuisines. The top five cities with the highest sales and the top five cuisines recommended for new restaurants were identified, providing actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
